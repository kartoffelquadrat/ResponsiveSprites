/** This file serves as properties file for absolute positioning of overlay elements. That means all values denoted here
 * must reflect the absolute pixel position of an overlay element. The position is determined by the overlay elements
 * top left corner, measured from the backdrops sprites top left corner. This can be dermined with an external tool,
 * e.g. mac os preview. Open the backdrop sprite, set the display settings to actual size, then measure the amount of
 * pixels in x and y from the top left corner to the desired top left overlay element position, e.g. using a display
 * ruler such as the screenshot util. */
